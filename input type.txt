@Html.TextBox("phone", null, new { id = "phone", type = "number", placeholder = "Phone number" })


Explanation:

"phone": The name of the form field, which is also the name attribute of the <input> tag.
null: The initial value of the text box. In this case, it is set to null because no default value is provided.
new { id = "phone", type = "number", placeholder = "Phone number" }: An anonymous object specifying additional HTML attributes.
